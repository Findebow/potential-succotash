## Installation and running application

* To begin you need to install node js on your computer:
    * https://nodejs.org/en/download/

* When node js is installed you need to run this command to install body-parser and express:
    * npm --save install express body-parser

* We are using MongoDB and mongoose so you need to run:
    * npm --save-dev install mongodb mongoose

* We are using jest to test our code:
    * npm --save-dev install jest

* Now you should be able to run our program by simple writing:
    * node index.js

* If you want to run and test our code as well you run:
    * npm run test


## Sending requests
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
* If you want to test and send requests to the API we recommend doing that on Postman:
